# RLTBT - RLT Backtest Toolkit

This is an extremely simple library of quick-and-dirty scripts related to certain (private) Google Colab notebook supporting backtest functions using data exported by SierraChart. This is not intended for wider use or becoming an open source project. Therefore, it lacks documentations and there is no plan of adding them.
