# RLTBT - RLT Backtest Toolkit

This is an extremely simple library connecting with certain (private) Google Colab notebook supporting backtest functions using data exported by SierraChart. This is not intended for wider use or to become an open source project. Therefore, it lacks documentations and there is no plan of adding them.
